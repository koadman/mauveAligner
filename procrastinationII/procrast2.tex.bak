\begin{abstract}
We describe an efficient local multiple alignment 
heuristic for the sensitive identification of 
conserved and repetitive regions in one or more DNA
sequences.  The GPL implementation of our algorithm in C++ is
called \texttt{procrastAligner} and is freely available from
\url{http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/procrastination}
\end{abstract}


\section{ Introduction }

\subsection{Brief history \& overview of sequence alignment}
\begin{itemize}

\item Pairwise local sequence alignment has a long and fruitful history
in computational biology and new approaches continue to be
proposed~\cite{ref-pattern,ref-chaos,ref-yass,ref-kahveciMAP}.

\item Local alignment can be used for orthology
mapping~\cite{ref-orthomcl}, genome assembly~\cite{ref-arachne2},
and information engineering tasks such as data
compression~\cite{ref-ane}. 

\item Recent advances in sequence data
acquisition technology~\cite{ref-454} provide low-cost sequencing
will continue to grow molecular sequence
databases. 

%motivation
\item To cope with advances in data volume, corresponding
advances in computational methods are necessary; thus we present
an efficient method for local multiple alignment of DNA sequence.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{why multiple alignment?}
\begin{itemize}

\item Unlike pairwise alignment, local multiple alignment constructs a
single multiple alignment for all occurrences of a motif in one or
more sequences.  The motif occurrences may be identical or have
degeneracy in the form of mismatches and indels.  

\item local multiple alignments identify the basic repeating units in one or
more sequences and can serve as a basis for downstream analysis
tasks such as multiple genome
alignment~\cite{ref-mauve,ref-mga,ref-mgcat,ref-deweyReview}, global
alignment with repeats~\cite{ref-otherSammethPaper,ref-aba}, or
repeat classification and analysis~\cite{ref-piler}. 

\item Local multiple
alignment differs from traditional pairwise methods for repeat
analysis which either identify repeat families \textit{de
novo}~\cite{ref-reputer} or using a database of known repeat
motifs~\cite{ref-repbase}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{related work on local multiple alignment}
\begin{itemize}

\item Eulerian path approach proposed by Zhang and Waterman~\cite{ref-related1}. 

\item ABA, A-bruijn multiple alignment proposed by Raphael et al~\cite{ref-aba}. 

\item anything else?


\end{itemize}
\subsection{what we offer/why we are different}
\begin{itemize}

%the gist
\item The local multiple alignment filtration method we present has been
designed to efficiently process large amounts of sequence data.  

%limitations
\item It
is not designed to detect subtle motifs such as transcription factor
binding sites in small, targeted sequence regions--stochastic
methods are better suited for such tasks~\cite{ref-PhyloGibbs}. 

%other info
\item However,
it is useful for sensitive detection of small and large repetitive regions
in whole genomes.

\end{itemize}
\section{Overview of the Method}\label{sec:overview}

\subsection{Seed detection}
\begin{itemize}

\item palindromic spaced seeds, seed families?

\item Our local multiple alignment method begins by generating
a set of candidate multi-matches using \textit{palindromic} spaced
seed patterns (~\cite{ref-procrast}).  The use of
\textit{palindromic} seed patterns offers computational savings by
allowing both strands of DNA to be processed simultaneously.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Seed chaining and procrastination}
\subsection{Gapped Extension}
\subsubsection{Gapped alignment via MUSCLE}
\begin{itemize}

\item grab 3*w nucleotides to the left/right of each chain. don't go past
chain component boundaries, though. 

\item trigger if chain is above some minimum score threshold.
idea is that extension is expensive, and so we need to minimize the number
of gapped extensions that do not improve the boundaries of the chain.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Score gapped alignment via sum of pairs}
\begin{itemize}

\item score the gapped alignment using Sum of pairs(or consensus) scoring.

\item objective function?

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Random walk of score landscape to extend homology border}
\begin{itemize}

\item if boundaries are improved, trigger another round of extension.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Processing Novel homologous sequence}    
\begin{itemize}
\item novel homologous sequence can be found during gapped extension
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Define boundaries with pairwise homology test}
\begin{itemize}
\item first, we unalign any non-homolgous sequence introduced during the extension process
\item then, we define common boundaries among all sequences in the alignment
\end{itemize}
\subsection{local multiple alignment scoring}
\begin{itemize}
\item how do we score?
\item anything to describe?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{local multiple alignment significance via simulations}
\begin{itemize}
\item simulations, guillaume user guide as outline?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{multiplicity}
\subsubsection{composition}
\subsubsection{length}
\subsection{Repeat family/subfamily/domains}
\subsubsection{downstream methods}

\section{Results}
We have created a program called \texttt{procrastAligner} for Linux,
Windows, and Mac OS X that implements the described algorithm. Our
open-source implementation is available as C++ source code licensed
under the GPL.
