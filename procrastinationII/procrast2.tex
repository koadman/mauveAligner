The identification of homologous DNA is a fundamental building block
of comparative genomic and molecular evolution studies.  To date,
methods to identify and align all homologous nucleotides in one or
more genomes have suffered poor scalability and limited accuracy.  We
propose a novel method that couples a gapped extension heuristic with
a previously described efficient filtration method for local multiple
alignment.  During gapped extension, we use the MUSCLE implementation
of progressive multiple alignment with iterative refinement.  The
resulting gapped extensions are global multiple alignments, and often
contain alignments of unrelated sequence.  We detect and remove such
undesirable alignments using a hidden Markov model to predict the
posterior probability of unrelated sequence.  We evaluate the
performance of our method and previous approaches on a hybrid dataset
of real genomic DNA with simulated interspersed repeats.  Our method
compares favorably to existing methods in terms of sensitivity,
positive predictive value, and localizing boundaries of homology.  The
described methods have been implemented in the free, open-source
\texttt{procrastAligner} software, available from: \ \

\section{Introduction}
The importance of accurate homology identification to comparative
genomics should not be underestimated\cite{Kumar07}. To date, pairwise
local sequence alignment methods\cite{ref-blastz,ref-ssearch,ref-pattern} have
been the prevailing technique to identify homologous nucleotides.
When more than two copies of a homologous sequence element are present
in the data, pairwise homology detection methods generate a listing of
all possible pairs of homologous elements in the form of pairwise
local alignments.  Apart from the obvious inefficiency of considering
all pairwise homology relationships, a collection of pairwise
alignments is not ideal because they are rarely amenable to
comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis without further
processing into a multiple alignment.

Local pairwise alignments can be merged to create a multiple alignment
by a variety of
methods\cite{ref-tba,ref-aba,ref-dialign,ref-related1}. Such methods
commonly assume that pairwise homology relationships are transitive,
such that if nucleotide $a$ is homologous to nucleotide $b$, and $b$
is to $c$, then $a$ must also be homologous to $c$.  Thus, in order to
merge pairwise alignments, such methods must tackle the challenging
problem of resolving inconsistent transitive homology relationships.
Multiple alignment has been demonstrated to be more accurate than
pairwise alignment, especially when dealing with a large number of
divergent sequences\cite{ref-mlagan,ref-aubergene}.  As the number of
homologous sequences grows, we might expect that the number of
inconsistent relationships in a collection of pairwise alignments
would grow quadratically, whereas a direct multiple alignment method
would provide an increasingly accurate alignment.  Moreover, highly repetitive
regions in the input sequences can cause serious efficiency problems
for pairwise methods, as they create $O(r^{2})$ pairwise alignments in
the presence of a repeat with $r$ copies.  Mammalian Alu repeats and
IS elements in microbes are two common examples of the overwhelming
abundance of repetitive sequence in whole genomes.

Local multiple alignment has the inherent potential to avoid pitfalls
associated with pairwise alignment. Although optimal multiple
alignment under the SP objective function remains
intractable\cite{ref-wangjiang}, progressive alignment heuristics
offer excellent speed and accuracy\cite{ref-clustalw,ref-tcoffee}
especially when combined with tree-independent iterative
refinement\cite{ref-muscle}, or probabilistic consistency
measures\cite{ref-probcons}. Rather than merging pairwise alignments,
why not exploit years of research into multiple alignment heuristics
by directly constructing a multiple alignment? We thus present a novel
heuristic for directly computing local multiple alignments via gapped
extension of chained seed matches.

\section{A heuristic for local multiple alignment}
Our method for computing local multiple alignments exploits the MUSCLE
multiple alignment algorithm to compute gapped extensions of ungapped
multi-match seeds (see Figure~\ref{fig-main}). Gapped alignments arise
when extending seeds to fully capture surrounding sequence
homology. Our method assumes that a fixed number of nucleotides
flanking a seed match are likely to be homologous and computes a
global multiple alignment on the flanking region.  Our assumption of
flanking homology often proves to be erroneous and results in an
alignment of unrelated sequences.  In the context of \textit{local}
multiple alignment, the fundamental problem with such an approach is
that current methods for progressive alignment with iterative
refinement compute \textit{global} alignments, i.e. they implicitly
assume that input sequences are homologous over their entire length.
To resolve the problem, we employ a hidden Markov model which detects
unrelated regions embedded in the global multiple alignment.
Unrelated regions are then removed from the alignment and the
local-multiple alignment is trimmed to reflect the updated boundaries
of homology.

Our method for local multiple alignment, as depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig-main}, has seven primary steps: (1) identifying
multi-match seeds in the input sequence, (2) chaining individual
seeds, (3) multiple alignment of regions between chained seeds, (4)
gapped extension of seed chains (5) detection of unrelated regions
using a hidden Markov model, (6) application of transitive homology
relationships, and (7) unalignment of any unrelated sequence to
produce final local multiple alignment.  Steps 2-7 are applied
repeatedly to seeds identified in step 1 to produce local multiple
alignments of all homologous nucleotides in the input sequence.

\caption{Overview of the method, starting with an input sequence and ending
with a set of local multiple alignments. First we (1) detect
multi-matches in the input sequence(s) using palindromic spaced seeds,
then we perform (2) chaining and extension of all multi-matches within
$w$ nt of each other.  In the present example, one chain exists and
contains two matches each with three match components labeled 1, 2,
and 3.  We then perform gapped alignment of the region between chained
matches (3).  In step (4), we perform a gapped extension by computing
a global multiple alignment on the regions to the left and right of
each chain component.  The resulting alignment may contain unrelated
sequence, so in step (5) we apply a hidden Markov model to detect
poorly aligned regions indicative of unrelated sequence.  Step (6)
computes transitive homology relationships to ensure a consistent
alignment and aid detection of divergent homologous sequences.
Finally, in step (7) we unalign regions found to be non-homologous.
If we find after step (2) that the alignment boundaries have been
extended, we return to step (4) for another round of chaining.}

\subsection{Extracting multi-matches from the input sequence}
Given a sequence $\mathcal{S}=s_1, s_2,\dots, s_N$ of length $N$
defined over an alphabet $\{A,C,G,T\}$, our goal is to identify all
significant local multiple alignments on subsequences of
$\mathcal{S}$. Our method first extracts candidate ungapped
alignments, or multi-matches, among subsequences in $\mathcal{S}$,
denoted as $\mathbf{M}$. To extract multi-matches from the input
sequence, we utilize a palindromic spaced seed pattern\cite{ref-zhang}, which is
analyzed at each position in the input sequence.  Previously we have
demonstrated that palindromic spaced seeds offer good efficiency and
reasonable sensitivity on a variety of input
sequences\cite{ref-procrast}.  We refer the number of matching regions
in $\mathcal{S}$ by a given match $M_i \in \mathbf{M}$ as the
\textit{multiplicity} of $M_i$, denoted as $|M_i|$. We refer to each
matching region of $M_i$ as a \textit{component} of $M_i$. Our
algorithm has an important limitation on the matches in $\mathbf{M}$:
no two matches $M_i$ and $M_j$ may have the same left-end coordinate,
except for the identity case when $i=j$.  This constraint has been
referred to by others as \textit{consistency} and
\textit{transitivity}\cite{ref-transitivity} of matches.

\subsection{Creating chains of multi-matches}
Once a list of multi-matches has been generated, we employ an
efficient chaining and filtration algorithm to identify overlapping
and nested chains of multi-matches\cite{ref-procrast}. In order to
chain process each region of sequence $\mathcal{O}(1)$ times, matches
are prioritized for chaining in order of decreasing multiplicity.  Our
method chains seed multi-matches of the same multiplicity $M_{i}$
occurring within $w$ characters of each other.  When a multi-match can
no longer be chained without including a gap larger than $w$
characters, neighboring \textit{subset} matches within $w$ characters
are identified. Each neighboring subset match is then \textit{linked}
to the chained match. We refer to the chained match as a
\textit{superset} match. Rather than immediately extend the subset
match(es), we \textit{procrastinate} and extend the subset match later
when it has the highest multiplicity of any match waiting to be
extended. When chaining a match with a linked superset, we immediately
include the entire region covered by the linked superset match and
thus eliminate the need to re-examine sequence already covered by a
previously chained match.

\subsection{Gapped extension of high-scoring chains}

After chaining a multi-match $M_i$, we perform gapped alignment on all
collinear regions located between two adjacent components to generate
unextended local multiple alignments. We first evaluate the chain to
decide whether expending computational resources on gapped extension
will be worthwhile. We can require that two or more seeds be present
in the chain and use lower seed weights ($k$), a technique which has
previously been proven
successful\cite{ref-blastz,ref-gappedblast,ref-blat}.  To perform a
gapped extension in each direction, we use MUSCLE to align a fixed
number of nucleotides ($l$) to the left and right of the current local
multiple alignment.  Small values of $l$ restrict the alignment search
space, while larger values require more computation but are
potentially more sensitive.  We have empirically determined that
setting $l$ based on multiplicity ($l = 70e^{-0.01*|M_{i}|}$) offers a
good tradeoff between speed and sensitivity.  The resulting extension
window is small for high multiplicity chains ($|M_{i}|\geq 30$),
keeping the alignment search space tractable.
%\begin{equation}
% \max(w, \sqrt{(\max(150^{2}-(2*|M_{i}|)^{2},0)}));
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Identifying unrelated regions}
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering \epsfig{file=./figures/hmm.eps,width=5.0in}
\caption{Hidden Markov model used to detect pairwise alignments of unrelated
sequence. The HMM has states which model alignment columns containing
homologous and unrelated sequence.  Emissions correspond to alignment
columns, for example \texttt{AA} indicates A aligned to A.  gO
indicates gap-open and gE gap extend. Alignment columns are treated as
strand-symmetric, so that AC also indicates CA and the reverse
complements TG and GT.}
\label{fig-hmm}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\end{figure}
The MUSCLE alignment software dutifully reports the highest scoring
global multiple alignment of input sequences, regardless of whether
they are related by common ancestry. As a consequence of the gapped
extension process, it is likely that we forcibly align unrelated
sequence. We have configured a hidden Markov model (Figure
~\ref{fig-hmm}) to detect alignments of unrelated sequence. The HMM
consists of two hidden states, Homologous and Unrelated. The
observable states are the pairwise alignment columns, which are all
possible pairs in $\texttt{{\{A,G,C,T,-\}}}$ with strand and species
symmetry, i.e. \texttt{AG=GA=TC=CT}.  The emission probabilities for
each possible pair of aligned nucleotides were extracted from the HOXD
substitution matrix presented by Chiaromonte \textit{et al}\cite{hoxd}.
We solved for the emission frequencies in the
homologous and unrelated state using the same equation used in to
calculate the values of the HOXD substitution matrix on 47.5\%G+C
content sequence\cite{hoxd}:
\begin{equation}
s(x,y)= \log_{2}{\Bigg(\frac{p(x,y)}{q_{1}(x)q_{2}(y)}\Bigg)}
\end{equation}
{w}here $p(x,y)$ is the fraction of the observed aligned pairs of
nucleotides $x$ and $y$ in the training set used and $q_{1}(x)$ and
$q_{2}(y)$ denote the background frequencies of $x$ and $y$,
respectively. Chiaramonte \textit{et al.} scaled the resulting
$s(x,y)$ values by an unreported value $\psi$ so the largest was 100,
with the rest rounded to the nearest integer.  Bacterial genomes range in GC content from 30-75\%, and given that the training
data has $47.5\%$~$G+C$ content,
the extremes our HMM is not likely to perform very well.  We instead
take the GC content of the whole genome into account and recompute
the emission probabilities accordingly.  Transmission probabilities
in the Unrelated state can be directly from the background nucleotide
distribution.  Thus, considering strand and species
symmetry, we can compute emission frequencies for the Unrelated state
of our HMM:
\begin{center}
$U_{AA}=U_{AT}=U_{TA}=U_{TT}=(\frac{f_{AT}}{2})(\frac{f_{AT}}{2})$
$U_{CC}=U_{CG}=U_{GC}=U_{GG}=(\frac{f_{GC}}{2})(\frac{f_{GC}}{2})$ 
$U_{AC}=U_{AG}=U_{TC}=U_{AG}=(\frac{f_{AT}}{2})(\frac{f_{GC}}{2})$ 
$U_{CA}=U_{CT}=U_{GA}=U_{GT}=(\frac{f_{GC}}{2})(\frac{f_{AT}}{2})$
\end{center}

Where $f_{GC}=$ and $f_{AT}$ are background frequencies of
G/C and A/T in the input genome, respectively.  For the Homologous state, we need to separate
substitution probability from background frequency, the product of which
forms our HMM emission parameters.  We derive emission probabilities for
the Homologous state as follows:
\begin{equation}
\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{AA}}{U_{AA}}\bigg) = \frac{91}{\psi},
\end{equation}
where $\frac{1}{\psi}$ is the unknown scaling factor used normalize $H_{CC}$ to 100. The full list of equations follows:
\begin{center}$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{AC}}{U_{AC}}\bigg) = \frac{-114}{\psi},$
$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{AG}}{U_{AC}}\bigg) = \frac{-31}{\psi}$ \\
$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{AT}}{U_{AC}}\bigg) = \frac{-123}{\psi},$
$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{CG}}{U_{CC}}\bigg) = \frac{-125}{\psi}$ \\
$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{AA}}{U_{AA}}\bigg) = \ \ \ \frac{91}{\psi},$
$\log_{2}\bigg(\frac{H_{CC}}{U_{CC}}\bigg) = \ \ \ \frac{100}{\psi}$ \\
\end{center}

The system of six equations has seven free variables.  Moreover, the $H_{xy}$ must sum to 1 to make a probability distribution:
\begin{equation}
H_{AA} + H_{AC} + H_{AG} + H_{AT} + H_{CC} + H_{CG} = 1
\end{equation}
%$0.03072937146$
%$32.54215601$
We can solve the above six equations for $H_{xy}$ and substitute the
resulting expressions in to the normalizing equation to solve for
$\psi$. For the HOXD matrix the scaling factor $\psi=32.5421$. Given
$\psi$, we can calculate values for all $H_{xy}$ in the HMM.

Emission frequencies for nucleotide substitutions can be derived from
any strand/species symmetric nucleotide substitution matrix, but gap-open
and extend frequencies can not.  To empirically estimate values
for the unrelated state we aligned a 10-kb, 48\%~GC content region
taken from \emph{E. coli} CFT073 (Accession AF447814.1, coordinates
37,300-38,300) with an unrelated sequence.  We generated an unrelated
sequence with identical nucleotide composition by reversing the
extracted sequence without complementation.  We then forced an
alignment with MUSCLE and counted the number of gap-open and gap-extend
columns in the alignment of unrelated sequences.  Gap-open and
extend frequencies for the homologous state were estimated by
constructing an alignment of 10kb of orthologous sequence shared among
a pair of divergent organisms.  We aligned the 48\%GC segment between
genes \textit{fruR} and \textit{secA} from \textit{E. coli} K12
(Accession U00096.21) and \emph{Y. pestis} CO92 (Accession
AL590842.1). We add the empirically derived gap-open and extend
frequencies for each state and normalize the emission frequencies to a
probability distribution.  The resulting emission probabilities are
reported in Figure~\ref{fig-hmm}.

Using the empirically derived transition and emission probabilities,
we apply the posterior HMM decoder implemented in Gerton Lunter's
HMMoC software\cite{hmmoc} to compute the posterior probability that
each alignment column represents homologous sequence.  Columns with a
p.p. below 0.5 are considered to be unrelated.  We then apply the
transitive homology principle to our predictions, resulting in a final
set of consistent homology predictions.  See Figure~\ref{fig-main},
steps 5 and 6 for an example. We trim the alignment to exclude all
columns beyond the Homologous state. If the original boundaries were
improved, we trigger another round of chaining (and consequently
another round of extension) in the same direction on the currently
active match $M_i$.  When gapped extension fails to improve boundaries
in one direction, extension in the other direction is attempted until
no further extension is possible.


\section{Results}
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering \epsfig{file=./figures/repeat_accuracy.eps,width=5.0in}
\caption{Accuracy of \texttt{procrastAligner} and \texttt{eulerAlign} in
recovering simulated repeat families implanted into the
\textit{Mycoplasma genitalium} genome.  Sum-of-pairs nucleotide
sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were measured for 110
combinations of branch length and multiplicity.  Three replicates of
each simulation were performed and average accuracy values are shown
here.  White points indicate perfect alignment of the simulated repeat
family.  Black points indicate the program completely failed to
recover any portion of the repeat family.  Mutations per site can be
calculated by multiplying branch length by the fixed substitution rate
of 0.085, and indel rate of 0.015.  For example, at branch length 20
there are 1.7 substitutions per site and 0.3 indels per site.  From
the figure, it is apparent that \texttt{procrastAligner} performs better
at higher mutation rates and multiplicities than \texttt{eulerAlign}.}
\label{fig-results}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\end{figure}

We have previously demonstrated the sensitivity of our chaining method
in finding Alu repeats in the human
genome\cite{ref-procrast}. Figure~\ref{fig-align} shows part of a
local multiple alignment of one such ALU family as generated with
\texttt{procrastAligner}. To highlight the benefits of our proposed
heuristic for gapped extension, we compare ~\texttt{procrastAligner}'s
performance to the Eulerian path method for local multiple alignment
as implemented by \texttt{eulerAlign}\cite{ref-related1}. The Eulerian
path method uses a \textit{de Bruijn} graph for filtration, but goes
beyond filtration to compute gapped alignments using banded dynamic
programming.  To our knowledge, \texttt{procrastAligner} and
\texttt{eulerAlign} represent the only two automated methods to
construct local multiple alignments directly from genomic DNA.

\subsection{Simulating interspersed repeats}
We evaluate accuracy of each method when aligning simulated repeat
families that have been inserted into the complete genome of
\emph{Mycoplasma genitalium}. \emph{M. genitalium} has been recognized
as a complex and repeat-rich genome, presenting a biologically
relevant and challenging example to evaluate alignment
methods\cite{ref-mycoplasma}. We simulated repeat families with 11
multiplicities ranging between 2 and 200 ($x$-axis in
Figure~\ref{fig-results}).  Each repeat copy has an average length
based on its family's multiplicity
($length=\frac{5000}{multiplicity}$).  Thus, high copy-number repeats
are short.  Evolution of repeat families was simulated on a star tree
topology.  The branch lengths were varied between 0 and 20 ($y$-axis
in Figure~\ref{fig-results}), with the nucleotide substitution rate
fixed at 0.085 per unit time, and the indel rate fixed at 0.015 per
unit time.  Rate heterogeneity among sites was modeled with a gamma
distribution ($\theta = 1.0, k = \frac{l}{2}$).  Indel size was
Poisson distributed with intensity 3, and insertions and deletions
were taken to be equally likely.  Mutation event times were simulated
according to a marked Poisson process.  Each family's ancestral
sequence was randomly generated using nucleotide frequencies equal to
the composition of \emph{Mycoplasma genitalium}
($A=0.34,T=0.34,G=0.16,C=0.16$). Insertion sites for repeat copies
were chosen uniformly randomly in the \textit{M. genitalium} genome,
allowing tandem repeats but prohibiting mosaic repeats.

\subsection{Alignment accuracy metrics}
We used each program to find local multiple alignments in each of the
110 modified \emph{M. genitalium} genomes and recorded alignment
accuracy as follows. We calculated sum-of-pairs nucleotide sensitivity
as $\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP} + \mathrm{FP}}$, where
$\mathrm{TP}$ is the number of aligned nucleotide pairs in the
program's output which are also aligned in the simulated repeat
family.  $\mathrm{FN}$ is the number of aligned nucleotide pairs in
the simulated repeat family which are missing from the program's
output.  This sensitivity measure is identical to the sum-of-pairs
accuracy defined by BaliBASE\cite{ref-balibase}.  We calculate the
positive predictive value (PPV) as $\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP} +
\mathrm{FP}}$, where $\mathrm{TP}$ is defined as above, and
$\mathrm{FP}$ is the total number of nucleotide pairs from the
program's output where one of the nucleotides are part of the
simulated repeat family and the other nucleotide was incorrectly
aligned.

\subsection{Accuracy when aligning interspersed repeats}
We applied \texttt{procrastAligner} and \texttt{eulerAlign} to the
hybrid simulated/real dataset.  Parameters used for each program were
configured to optimize each program's chance of accurately aligning
each pattern and were configured as
follows:\\\texttt{procrastAlign}:\texttt{--z=13--w=50},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \texttt{eulerAlign}:\texttt{-k 15 -l -i 1000 -v} \\
Simulations for each of the 110 combinations of branch length and
multiplicity were replicated three times and alignments generated in
parallel using a 156 node compute cluster.  Results of the experiments
are reported in Figure~\ref{fig-results}. The figure illustrates the
sensitivity and PPV of \texttt{procrastAligner} and
\texttt{eulerAlign} on datasets ranging from 0 substitutions and
indels per site to 1.7 substitutions and 0.3 indels per site.  As
mutation rates and repeat multiplicity increase alignment accuracy
decreases for both methods, with accuracy of \texttt{eulerAlign}
decreasing faster than \texttt{procrastAligner}.  We conjecture that
\texttt{procrastAligner}'s improved accuracy largely derives from its
use of spaced seed patterns\cite{ref-procrast} and tolerance of gaps.
The Eulerian path method requires exactly matching $k$-mers to seed
gapped alignment extensions.

values indicate complement strand.  Local multiple alignment was
generated with \texttt{procrastAlign} with parameters: \texttt{--z=9
--w=50}.  }
\label{fig-align}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Boundary prediction}
Another crucial part is boundary prediction.
That said, do you think it would be a good idea to separate
underpredictions from overpredictions?  I suggest this since
overpredictions are what we really focus on in the manuscript (section
2.3.1), as we emphasize that our method takes great care to avoid
reporting unrelated sequence in the lma's. and in fact, we do a good
job of this in all cases. poor performance on underpredictions speaks
more towards a lack in sensitivity of our method, as it is unable to
capture all of the homologous regions surrounding seed matches or
chained matches due to several possible reasons. of course we want to
perform well in both areas, but maybe we can mark the underpredictions
in high multiplicity repeats as an area of future improvement via
using families of spaced seeds or more involved seed match component
processing/merging. thoughts?

\section{Discussion}
We have presented a sensitive and efficient heuristic for local
multiple alignment. We have extended our previous results by
converting chains of ungapped multi-matches into gapped local multiple
alignments. Our method is based around an efficient heuristic for
local multiple alignment, featuring a novel method for gapped
extensions joining global multiple alignment with a hidden Markov
model based homology test.  Experimental results demonstrate that the
described method offers a level of alignment accuracy far exceeding
that of previous methods.
Further improvement of the alignment methodology will likely require
increasingly sensitive methods for seed matching in conjunction with a
statistical methodology to assign significance to local multiple
alignments.  One possible avenue to increase seed matching sensitivity
would be merging overlapping seed matches into a shorter, higher
multiplicity match.  A second avenue would be use of palindromic seed
families instead of using individual seed patterns. With increased
seed matching sensitivity comes additional false positive seed hits,
so a statistical test for rejecting insignificant local alignments
will likely be required.  Exact computation of $p$-values for local
multiple alignments remains a daunting challenge, although fast
approximation methods for pairwise alignments have shown
promise\cite{repseek} and potentially can be extended to multiple
alignments\cite{ref-related1}.

\subsection{Implementation}
