\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
We describe an efficient local multiple alignment 
heuristic for the sensitive identification of 
conserved and repetitive regions in one or more DNA
sequences.  The GPL implementation of our algorithm in C++ is
called \texttt{procrastAligner} and is freely available from
\url{http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/procrastination}
\end{abstract}


\section{ Introduction }

\subsection{Brief history \& overview of sequence alignment}
\begin{itemize}

\item Pairwise local sequence alignment has a long and fruitful history
in computational biology and new approaches continue to be
proposed~\cite{ref-pattern,ref-chaos,ref-yass,ref-kahveciMAP}.

\item Local alignment can be used for orthology
mapping~\cite{ref-orthomcl}, genome assembly~\cite{ref-arachne2},
and information engineering tasks such as data
compression~\cite{ref-ane}. 

\item Recent advances in sequence data
acquisition technology~\cite{ref-454} provide low-cost sequencing
will continue to grow molecular sequence
databases. 

%motivation
\item To cope with advances in data volume, corresponding
advances in computational methods are necessary; thus we present
an efficient method for local multiple alignment of DNA sequence.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{why multiple alignment?}
\begin{itemize}

\item Unlike pairwise alignment, local multiple alignment constructs a
single multiple alignment for all occurrences of a motif in one or
more sequences.  The motif occurrences may be identical or have
degeneracy in the form of mismatches and indels.  

\item local multiple alignments identify the basic repeating units in one or
more sequences and can serve as a basis for downstream analysis
tasks such as multiple genome
alignment~\cite{ref-mauve,ref-mga,ref-mgcat,ref-deweyReview}, global
alignment with repeats~\cite{ref-otherSammethPaper,ref-aba}, or
repeat classification and analysis~\cite{ref-piler}. 

\item Local multiple
alignment differs from traditional pairwise methods for repeat
analysis which either identify repeat families \textit{de
novo}~\cite{ref-reputer} or using a database of known repeat
motifs~\cite{ref-repbase}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{related work on local multiple alignment}
\begin{itemize}

\item Eulerian path approach proposed by Zhang and Waterman~\cite{ref-related1}. 

\item ABA, A-bruijn multiple alignment proposed by Raphael et al~\cite{ref-aba}. 

\item RepeatGluer? Pevzner et al~\cite{ref-repeatgluer}. 

\item anything else?


\end{itemize}
\subsection{what we offer/why we are different}
\begin{itemize}

%the gist
\item Spaced Seeds$+$Procrastination$+$Extension$+$Simulations

%limitations
\item It
is not designed to detect subtle motifs such as transcription factor
binding sites in small, targeted sequence regions--stochastic
methods are better suited for such tasks~\cite{ref-PhyloGibbs}. 


\end{itemize}
\section{Overview of the Method}\label{sec:overview}

\subsection{Seed detection}
\begin{itemize}

\item palindromic spaced seeds, seed families?

\item Our local multiple alignment method begins by generating
a set of candidate multi-matches using \textit{palindromic} spaced
seed patterns (~\cite{ref-procrast}).  

\item The use of
\textit{palindromic} seed patterns offers computational savings by
allowing both strands of DNA to be processed simultaneously.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Seed chaining and procrastination}
\begin{itemize}
\item briefly describe and review original procrastAlign algorithm
\item point out that this current work is natural "extension" of previous work.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Gapped Extension}
\begin{itemize}
\item After finding \& chaining seeds in input sequence, we would like to perform gapped
extension to detect all surrounding homologous sequence. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Gapped alignment via MUSCLE}
\begin{itemize}
\item we employ MUSCLE to perform gapped alignment surrounding the chains

\item we trigger gapped alignment if chain is above some minimum score threshold.
idea is that extension is expensive, and so we need to minimize the number
of gapped extensions that do not improve the boundaries of the chain.

\item we grab 3*w nucleotides to the left/right of each chain. don't go past
chain component boundaries, though. 

\item we score the resulting gapped alignment via sum of pairs(computeSPScore)
\item if we had a way to account for gaps in consensus, we could also 
score this with the consensus sequence(see RepeatScout~\cite{ref-repeatscout})
\item do we need to say something about the objective function?

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Random walk of score landscape to extend homology border}

\begin{itemize}
\item after scoring each column of the gapped extension, we would like
to determine where the homology ends/begins in this region
\item we do this by performing a random walk of the column score landscape
\item we stop when we reach the record height
\item we determine the record height by simulations(put in supplemental material?)
\item all high scoring segments in the gapped extension are reported
\item if boundaries of the original chain are improved, trigger another round of extension.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Processing Novel homologous sequence}    
\begin{itemize}
\item novel homologous sequence can be found during gapped extension
\item should briefly describe what we do with this 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Define boundaries with pairwise homology test}
\begin{itemize}
\item our extension is not quite finished yet. Everything ok so far except that we could
still be including non-homologous sequence in our extended chain(local multiple alignment).
\item Define sets/subsets/boundaries with a pairwise homology test
\item first, we unalign any non-homolgous sequence introduced during the extension process
\item then, we define common boundaries among all sequences in the alignment
\end{itemize}
\subsection{local multiple alignment scoring}
\begin{itemize}
\item finally, we get a final score of our left/right extended chains using sum of pairs
\item keep track of multiplicity, length(?)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{local multiple alignment significance via simulations}
basically want to extend blast statistics to multiple local alignment. How?
\begin{itemize}
\item Extending Repseek simulations to multiple
\item Tompa et al, estimating the parameters for multiple alignments
\item will involve running procrastAlign with fixed parameters on sequences varying in composition and length
\item also will have to take into account multiplicity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anything else?}
\begin{itemize}
\item detect mosaic structure of consensus repeat families, breaks
    families into subset domains
\item visualization and/or incorporation into multiple alignment 
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
We have created a program called \texttt{procrastAligner} for Linux,
Windows, and Mac OS X that implements the described algorithm. Our
open-source implementation is available as C++ source code licensed
under the GPL.
