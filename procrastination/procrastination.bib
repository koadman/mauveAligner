 annote="Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is difficult in the presence of lateral gene transfer
 and other processes generating conflicting signals. We develop a new approach to this problem
 using ideas borrowed from algorithmic information theory. It selects the hypothesis that
 simultaneously minimizes the descriptive complexity of the tree(s) plus the data when encoded
 using those tree(s). In practice this is the hypothesis that can compress the data the most.
 We show not only that phylogenetic compression is an efficient method for encoding most phylogenetic
 data sets and is more efficient than compression schemes designed for single sequences, but also
 that it provides a clear information theoretic rule for determining when a collection of conflicting
 trees is a better explanation of the data than a single tree. By casting the parsimony problem in
 this more general framework, we also conclude that the so-called total-evidence tree--the tree
 constructed from all the data simultaneously--is not always the most economical explanation of the
  data.

@article{ref-buhler05,
    abstract = {The challenge of similarity search in massive DNA sequence databases has inspired major changes in BLAST-style alignment tools, which accelerate search by inspecting only pairs of sequences sharing a common short "seed," or pattern of matching residues. Some of these changes raise the possibility of improving search performance by probing sequence pairs with several distinct seeds, any one of which is sufficient for a seed match. However, designing a set of seeds to maximize their combined sensitivity to biologically meaningful sequence alignments is computationally difficult, even given recent advances in designing single seeds. This work describes algorithmic improvements to seed design that address the problem of designing a set of n seeds to be used simultaneously. We give a new local search method to optimize the sensitivity of seed sets. The method relies on efficient incremental computation of the probability that an alignment contains a match to a seed pi, given that it has already failed to match any of the seeds in a set Pi. We demonstrate experimentally that multi-seed designs, even with relatively few seeds, can be significantly more sensitive than even optimized single-seed designs.},

@article{ref-PhyloGibbs,
    abstract = {A central problem in the bioinformatics of gene regulation is to find the binding sites for regulatory proteins. One of the most promising approaches toward identifying these short and fuzzy sequence patterns is the comparative analysis of orthologous intergenic regions of related species. This analysis is complicated by various factors. First, one needs to take the phylogenetic relationship between the species into account in order to distinguish conservation that is due to the occurrence of functional sites from spurious conservation that is due to evolutionary proximity. Second, one has to deal with the complexities of multiple alignments of orthologous intergenic regions, and one has to consider the possibility that functional sites may occur outside of conserved segments. Here we present a new motif sampling algorithm, PhyloGibbs, that runs on arbitrary collections of multiple local sequence alignments of orthologous sequences. The algorithm searches over all ways in which an arbitrary number of binding sites for an arbitrary number of transcription factors (TFs) can be assigned to the multiple sequence alignments. These binding site configurations are scored by a Bayesian probabilistic model that treats aligned sequences by a model for the evolution of binding sites and "background" intergenic DNA. This model takes the phylogenetic relationship between the species in the alignment explicitly into account. The algorithm uses simulated annealing and Monte Carlo Markov-chain sampling to rigorously assign posterior probabilities to all the binding sites that it reports. In tests on synthetic data and real data from five Saccharomyces species our algorithm performs significantly better than four other motif-finding algorithms, including algorithms that also take phylogeny into account. Our results also show that, in contrast to the other algorithms, PhyloGibbs can make realistic estimates of the reliability of its predictions. Our tests suggest that, running on the five-species multiple alignment of a single gene's upstream region, PhyloGibbs on average recovers over 50% of all binding sites in S. cerevisiae at a specificity of about 50%, and 33% of all binding sites at a specificity of about 85%. We also tested PhyloGibbs on collections of multiple alignments of intergenic regions that were recently annotated, based on ChIP-on-chip data, to contain binding sites for the same TF. We compared PhyloGibbs's results with the previous analysis of these data using six other motif-finding algorithms. For 16 of 21 TFs for which all other motif-finding methods failed to find a significant motif, PhyloGibbs did recover a motif that matches the literature consensus. In 11 cases where there was disagreement in the results we compiled lists of known target genes from the literature, and found that running PhyloGibbs on their regulatory regions yielded a binding motif matching the literature consensus in all but one of the cases. Interestingly, these literature gene lists had little overlap with the targets annotated based on the ChIP-on-chip data. The PhyloGibbs code can be downloaded from http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/~nimwegen/cgi-bin/phylogibbs.cgi or http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsidd/phylogibbs.

@article{ref-orthomcl,
    abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

It specifies a class of patterns assumed to witness a potential similarity, and this choice is decisive for the selectivity and sensitivity of the whole method.

First, we define the group criterion combining the advantages of the single-seed and double-seed approaches used in existing algorithms. Second, we introduce transition-constrained seeds that extend spaced seeds by the possibility of distinguishing transition and transversion mismatches. We provide analytical data as well as experimental results, obtained with the YASS software, supporting both improvements.

Here, the first step is to align two or several evolutionary related sequences and, in recent years, a number of computer programs have been developed for alignment of large genomic sequences. Some of these programs are extremely fast but often time-efficiency is achieved at the expense of sensitivity. One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an anchored-alignment approach. In a first step, a fast heuristic identifies a chain of strong sequence similarities that serve as anchor points. In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more sensitive method. We present CHAOS, a novel algorithm for rapid identification of chains of local sequence similarities among large genomic sequences. Similarities identified by CHAOS are used as anchor points to improve the running time of the DIALIGN alignment program. Systematic test runs show that this method can reduce the running time of DIALIGN by more than 93% while affecting the quality of the resulting alignments by only 1%.

    abstract = {SUMMARY: Repeated elements such as satellites and transposons are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes. De novo computational identification and classification of such elements is a challenging problem. Therefore, repeat annotation of sequenced genomes has historically largely relied on sequence similarity to hand-curated libraries of known repeat families. We present a new approach to de novo repeat annotation that exploits characteristic patterns of local alignments induced by certain classes of repeats. We describe PILER, a package of efficient search algorithms for identifying such patterns. Novel repeats found using PILER are reported for Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thalania and Drosophila melanogaster.

We show that the approximation algorithms used in two popular motif-finding programs, MEME and Consensus, can fail to accurately compute the P-value. RESULTS: We present two new algorithms: one for the evaluation of the P-values of a range of motif scores, and a faster one for the evaluation of the P-value of a single motif score. Both exhibit more reliability than existing algorithms, and the latter algorithm is comparable in speed to the fastest existing method.

 annote="MOTIVATION: Internal repeats in coding sequences correspond to structural
 and functional units of proteins. Moreover, duplication of fragments of coding
 sequences is known to be a mechanism to facilitate evolution. Identification of
 repeats is crucial to shed light on the function and structure of proteins, and
 explain their evolutionary past. The task is difficult because during the course
 of evolution many repeats diverged beyond recognition. RESULTS: We introduce a new
 method TRUST, for ab initio determination of internal repeats in proteins. It provides
 an improvement in prediction quality as compared to alternative state-of-the-art
 methods. The increased sensitivity and accuracy of the method is achieved by exploiting
 the concept of transitivity of alignments. Starting from significant local suboptimal
 alignments, the application of transitivity allows us to (1) identify distant repeat
 homologues for which no alignments were found; (2) gain confidence about consistently
 well-aligned regions; and (3) recognize and reduce the contribution of non-homologous
 repeats. This re-assessment step enables us to derive a virtually noise-free profile
 representing a generalized repeat with high fidelity. We also obtained superior specificity
 by employing rigid statistical testing for self-sequence and profile-sequence alignments.
 Assessment was done using a database of repeat annotations based on structural superpositioning.
 The results show that TRUST is a useful and reliable tool for mining tandem and non-tandem
 repeats in protein sequence databases, capable of predicting multiple repeat types with
 varying intervening segments within a single sequence. AVAILABILITY: The TRUST server
 (together with the source code) is available at http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/programs/trustwww
