 needed to transform one permutation into the other."#"Their algorithm
 (restricted to distance calculation) proceeds in two stages: in the first
 stage, the overlap graph induced by the permutation is decomposed into
 connected components; then, in the second stage, certain graph structures
 (hurdles and others) are identified."#"Berman and Hannenhalli avoided the
 explicit computation of the overlap graph and gave an O(nalpha(n))
 algorithm, based on a Union-Find structure, to find its connected
 components, where alpha is the inverse Ackerman function."#"Since for all
 practical purposes alpha(n) is a constant no larger than four, this
 algorithm has been the fastest practical algorithm to date."#"In this paper,
 we present a new linear-time algorithm for computing the connected
 components, which is more efficient than that of Berman and Hannenhalli in
 both theory and practice."#"Our algorithm uses only a stack and is very easy
 to implement."#"We give the results of computational experiments over a
 large range of permutation pairs produced through simulated evolution; our
 experiments show a speed-up by a factor of 2 to 5 in the computation of
 the connected components and by a factor of 1.3 to 2 in the overall
 distance computation."}

 entire mammalian genomes and to increase its sensitivity. This work

 powerful guide in the prediction of the protein structure and in
 identifying key functional residues, however, the utility of any
 prediction is completely dependent on the accuracy of the alignment."#"In
 this paper we describe a suite of reference alignments derived from the
 comparison of protein three-dimensional structures together with
 evaluation measures and software that allow automatically generated
 alignments to be benchmarked."#"We test the OXBench benchmark suite on
 alignments generated by the AMPS multiple alignment method, then apply the
 suite to compare eight different multiple alignment algorithms."#"The
 benchmark shows the current state-of-the art for alignment accuracy and
 provides a baseline against which new alignment algorithms may be judged.
 RESULTS: The simple hierarchical multiple alignment algorithm, AMPS,
 performed as well as or better than more modern methods such as CLUSTALW
 once the PAM250 pair-score matrix was replaced by a BLOSUM series matrix.
 AMPS gave an accuracy in Structurally Conserved Regions (SCRs) of 89.9\%
 over a set of 672 alignments."#"The T-COFFEE method on a data set of
 families with <8 sequences gave 91.4\% accuracy, significantly better than
 CLUSTALW (88.9\%) and all other methods considered here."#"The complete suite
 is available from http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk."#"CONCLUSIONS: The
 OXBench suite of reference alignments, evaluation software and results
 database provide a convenient method to assess progress in sequence
 alignment techniques."#"Evaluation measures that were dependent on
 comparison to a reference alignment were found to give good discrimination
 between methods."#"The STAMP Sc Score which is independent of a reference
 alignment also gave good discrimination."#"Application of OXBench in this
 paper shows that with the exception of T-COFFEE, the majority of the
 improvement in alignment accuracy seen since 1985 stems from improved
 pair-score matrices rather than algorithmic refinements."#"The maximum
 theoretical alignment accuracy obtained by pooling results over all
 methods was 94.5\% with 52.5\% accuracy for alignments in the 0-10
 percentage identity range."#"This suggests that further improvements in
 accuracy will be possible in the future."}

 hotspots for eukaryotic chromosome evolution. This localized chromosomal
 instability may play a role in rapidly evolving lineage-specific gene
 families and in fostering large-scale changes in gene order. Computational
 algorithms that take into account these dynamic forces along with
 traditional models of chromosomal rearrangement show promise for
 reconstructing the natural history of eukaryotic chromosomes."}

 as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition."#"Here,
 we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local
